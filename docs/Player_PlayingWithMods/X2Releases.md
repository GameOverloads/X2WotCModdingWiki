# XCOM 2 Releases

XCOM 2 has been released on several platforms, and while this is the same game overall, they are different in these aspects:

### Mod support

Which mods can be used with this game release.

### Mod installation

How can you install mods.

**Automatic** means installing mods quickly and easily, without having to manually move any files.

**Manual** means you have to download the mods yourself, and place them in the game's directory.

### Alternative Mod Launcher

[**AML**](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/xcom2-launcher/wiki) support is important, as it's way better than the official 2K Launcher.

## Steam Release - BEST RELEASE

Best release overall, since it's the easiest to use mods with, including one-click installation from [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/268500/workshop/) and automatic mod updates.

**Mod support:** official, works with all mods.

**Mod installation:** automatic or manual.

**Alternative Mod Launcher:** fully supported.

## GOG Release

[XCom 2 Standalone](https://www.gog.com/en/game/xcom_2)
[XCom 2: War of the Chosen](https://www.gog.com/en/game/xcom_2_war_of_the_chosen)

Second best option. Works with all mods, but they must be installed manually.

**Mod support:** unofficial, works with all mods.

**Mod installation:** manual.

**Alternative Mod Launcher:** supported, but **[no-steam workaround](https://github.com/X2CommunityCore/xcom2-launcher/wiki/FAQ#is-there-a-way-to-use-aml-without-steam)** is required.

## Epic Games Store Release

[XCom 2 Standalone](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/xcom-2)
[XCom 2 Collection (Includes War for the Chosen and all DLC)](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/xcom-2--collection)

The worst release by far. Not only it does not support a lot of mods, it also does not work with AML, and even using launch arguments (to enable console, for example) is a [**huge hassle**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/ufxzi5/enabling_cheats_on_xcom_2_with_the_epic_games/i6xwjek/).

**Mod support:** unofficial, does not work with Highlander, Long War 2, or any other mods that requires them. Supposedly does not work with mods that contain cooked textures.

**Mod installation:** manual.

**Alternative Mod Launcher:** not supported.

## SteamDeck

Seems to support AML and modding, follow **[these instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/LWotC/comments/ugmewz/getting_lwotc_working_on_the_steamdeck/)**.

## Linux

It seems to be possible to use mods and even AML on Linux. You can try looking for information about that in the [#alternative_mod_launcher](https://discord.gg/dF5xzWxJ5K) chat history.

## MacOS

It seems to be possible to use at least some mods with the MacOS version of the game. AML support is unknown. 

## Android / Switch

Do not support mods in any way.
