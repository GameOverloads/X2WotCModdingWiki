# List of Superseded Mods

The following mods are outdated and have been replaced by newer, better versions. Check your mod list and make sure to replace all mods from "Do NOT Use" category with mods from "Use" category.

Note: this list is meant for War of the Chosen, not vanilla XCOM 2.

## Improve Unit Health Bar

The base game health bar is lacking in functionality, so a lot of various mods have been created to improve it.

### Do NOT Use

* [Additional Icons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=646244015) - this is a vanilla mod.
* [[WOTC] Additional Icons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127409511) - WOTC port of the previous mod, outdated.
* [[WotC] Numeric Health Display](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1126938196) - redesigns the health bar, outdated.

### Use (Choose One)

* [[WOTC] Show Health Values](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1123174832) - displays HP numbers and nothing else.
* [[WOTC] Unit Flag Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2285967646) - displays unit stats.
* [Tactical Information Overhaul [WOTC]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1630804593) - displays unit stats and redesigns the health bar.

## Improve Soldier Promotion Screen

War of the Chosen has two promotion screens, the old vertical one is used for regular soldiers in the Armory, and the new horizontal one is used for Faction Heroes and when visiting the Training Center. This is hardly convenient, so the community has made several mods to make the game always use the new horizontal promotion screen.

### Do NOT Use

* [[WOTC] New Promotion Screen by Default](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1124609091) - outdated and has some bugs.
* [[WOTC] Train from Armoury](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133854368) - redundant and incompatible with mods that make the game always use the New Promotion Screen.

### Use 

* [[WOTC] Community Promotion Screen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2550561145) - updated and improved version of **New Promotion Screen by Default**. If any mod requires New Promotion Screen by Default, you can always use Community Promotion Screen instead, and ignore the warnings. You can also grab [[WOTC] Stats on New Promotion Screen](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1716973380) while you are at it. 
* Warning! Both New Promotion Screen by Default and Community Promotion Screen are ***NOT*** compatible with [Musashis RPG Overhaul](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1280477867), since it has its own version of New Promotion Screen by Default integrated.

## Soldier Icons

These mods add icons that can be used to select soldiers during tactical without having to find them on the screen.

### Do NOT Use

* [Select Soldier Icons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630391471) - outdated.

### Use

* [[WOTC] Select Soldier Icons Redux](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960880496)

## Extended Personnel Info

### Use

* [[WOTC] Extended Personnel Info Redux](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965980985)


## Overwatch All Button

Often you want to put all of your soldiers on Overwatch, and doing it one by one is tedious, so many people use a mod to add the "Overwatch All" button.

### Do NOT Use

* [Overwatch All/Others](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=621695447) - this is a vanilla mod.
* [Smart Overwatch All [WotC]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1123486456) - outdated.

### Use (Choose One)

* [Overwatch All/Others WotC](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133368143). Make sure to add [[WOTC] Core Collection Meta Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2166295671) to fix some issues with the mod. You can also add [[WOTC] Automatic Reload by Iridar](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2595660540) if you want soldiers to automatically reload before going on Overwatch, if they have Action Points to spare.

## Unrestricted Customization

Allows any soldier to use any cosmetic body parts, and allows each soldier to use the same appearance for any armor they equip.

### Do NOT Use

* [Unrestricted Armour Customization](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=619159905) - this is a vanilla mod.
* [Unrestricted Customization - Wotc](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1135440846) - original WOTC mod.

* [[WOTC] Unrestricted Customization Redux](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2438621356) - improved version.

## Spark Custom Class Support

Normally SPARKs can be of only one soldier class, `Spark`. So if you want SPARKs to be able to promote to different soldier classes, just like regular Rookies, you need a mod.

### Do NOT Use

* [SPARK Custom Class Support](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729610025) - does not work correctly in WOTC.
* [SPARK Custom Class Support WOTC](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128879172) - outdated.

### Use

## More Utility Slots

Add more utility slots for your soldiers.

### Do NOT Use

* [[WOTC] Tons Of Utility Items](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1271711184) - unnecessarily invasive and is hard incompatible with any mod that uses Highlander to add custom inventory slots.

### Use

* [[WOTC] More Base Utility Slots](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1448532065)


## Vest and Ammo Slots

Add Vest-only and Ammo-only inventory slot for your soldiers.

### Do NOT Use

* [Ammo and Vest Slots](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=674420475) - this is a vanilla mod.
* [Ammo and Vest Slots [WOTC]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1123704945) - uses outdated tech, making it hard incompatible with many other mods that want to do something with inventory slots.

### Use

* [WotC Vest Slot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1293714688) - for Vest slot.
* There is currently no standalone mod for adding an Ammo slot to all soldiers. However, it can be achieved via small config tweak. 

1) Open `..\Documents\my games\XCOM2 War of the Chosen\XComGame\Config\XComGameData.ini` in any text editor.

2) Scroll to the end of the file and add the following lines:

    [XComGame.X2AbilityTemplateManager]
    AbilityUnlocksAmmoPocket = "Loot"

3) Save and close the file. All done, the next time you start the game, all soldiers should have an Ammo slot.


## Prevent Unconscious Effect

Many enemies have attacks that can render XCOM units unconscious, which is very punishing. Many people prefer to use a mod to prevent it from happening.

### Do NOT Use

* [Remove Unconsciousness Tests](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878583105) - this is a vanilla mod.
* [Impairment Rebalance](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=659621834) - this is a vanilla mod.
